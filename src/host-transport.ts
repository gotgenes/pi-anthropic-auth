 * Resolves Pi's built-in Anthropic `streamSimple` transport at runtime.
 *
 * A static `import { streamSimpleAnthropic } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/anthropic"`
 * does **not** work under Pi's extension loader: pi loads extensions with
 * `jiti`, whose alias map covers `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (→ the host's
 * `dist/index.js`) and `@earendil-works/pi-ai/oauth` but **not** the
 * `./anthropic` subpath.  jiti's prefix-based alias matching turns the
 * subpath import into `dist/index.js/anthropic` — a nonexistent path — and
 * `import.meta.resolve("@earendil-works/pi-ai/anthropic")` fails the same way.
 *
 * `import.meta.resolve("@earendil-works/pi-ai")` *does* resolve (jiti's alias
 * handles the bare specifier), so this helper resolves the root entry, derives
 * the package directory, and dynamically imports the concrete provider file —
 * the same file the `exports` `./anthropic` subpath points at.  That yields
 * the real `streamSimpleAnthropic`, not pi-ai 0.79.8's lazy registry stub
 * (see Issue #28).
 *
 * Resolving the delegate this way (rather than capturing it from the API
 * registry) is what keeps our `streamSimple` wrapper from being clobbered by
 * the lazy stub's first-call `register()`.
 *
 * @returns the built-in `streamSimpleAnthropic` transport.
 * @throws when the root package cannot be resolved or the provider module
 *   does not export `streamSimpleAnthropic` (e.g. a future pi-ai layout
 *   change).
